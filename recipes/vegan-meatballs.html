<h4>A nice meatball meal... Yum!</h4>

<p>
  These vegan meatballs are juicy, tender, cheesy, garlicky, and packed with flavor. The smell of them baking in the oven carries the promise of a comforting Italian meal on its
  way.
</p>
<p>There’s truly nothing better. So put on Frank Sinatra and start rolling! You’re guaranteed to have a good time and an enjoyable meal</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoon ground flax meal</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced or grated</li>
  <li>1/4 cup finely diced white onion</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley, or 2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons breadcrumbs, plain or Italian</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated vegan Parmesan</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds, optional</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon chili flakes</li>
  <li>1 (12-ounce) package Impossible Foods ground beef</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Whisk together the ground flax meal and water in a small bowl. Set aside for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>
    Meanwhile, add the garlic, onion, parsley, breadcrumbs, nutritional yeast, vegan Parmesan, oregano, fennel seeds (if using), onion powder, black pepper, salt, and chili flakes
    to a medium-sized mixing bowl. Whisk to combine.
  </li>
  <li>Add the flax egg and Impossible meat. Use clean hands to mix just until combined.</li>
  <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside a small bowl or glass of water.</li>
  <li>
    Using a cookie scoop or rounded tablespoon to measure, gently roll 1-inch balls and place them on the baking sheet. Dip your fingers in the water to make it easier to form your
    meatballs. You should have 12 to 16 meatballs.
  </li>
  <li>Refrigerate the meatballs for 30 minutes. This helps them keep their shape and provides a juicier, more tender texture.</li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F.</li>
  <li>
    Bake the meatballs until browned, 10 to 14 minutes. To check for doneness, cut one in half. It should be largely cooked through, although a very small amount of pinkness at the
    center is okay.
  </li>
  <li>Enjoy immediately.</li>
</ol>
